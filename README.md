# Shaiya Guild Rank Reporter
### Reports at which place our guild has ranked.

### It scrapes the private server's website and looks inside this table.

### Searches for the given guild in that table and collects the data such as:
<ul>
    <li>Guild Points</li>
    <li>Guild Rank Position</li>
    <li>Guild Rank Position As Ordinal Number (1st, 2nd and so on)</li>
</ul>

### After the data is gathered it sends a message to our discord server.
